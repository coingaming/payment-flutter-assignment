# Payments Flutter Assignment

## Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates basic movie browsing functionality using The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

You will be integrating the TMDB API. An API key is required to fetch data from their server. You can check [this guide](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) for obtaining an API key.

## Features

1. Main Screen:

   - Displays a vertical list of movies fetched from TMDB API
   - Each list item shows the movie's image and title
   - Tapping an item opens the Detail Screen

2. Detail Screen:
   - Appears as a bottom sheet or you can navigate it to other page
   - Shows the selected movie's image and basic information
   - Includes a play button that displays a snackbar with the movie name when tapped

## API Integration

This project uses [The Movie Database (TMDb) API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) for fetching movie data. Make sure to sign up for an API key and add it to the project as per the TMDB documentation.

## Requirements and Guidelines

- Your code should compile without errors and the app should run on both iOS and Android seamlessly.
- Show a loader while data is loading and display an error snackbar in case of errors.
- Use the BLoC pattern if possible.
- Implement the app in a modular and reusable way.
- Most importantly, keep things simple and fun!
- Once you have completed the task, share the link to the repository on a code hosting site (GitHub, Bitbucket, etc.).
- Please ensure that we have access to your project when you submit it for review.

## App Design

Below is a basic mockup of the app design:
